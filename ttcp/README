This directory contains an RTEMS application for measuring TCP/UDP
network throughput.   The ttcp_orig subdirectory contains the original
UNIX program which can be compiled and run on your host machine.

One noteworthy item is that I was able to get the UNIX test program
running under RTEMS with no changes to the test program itself.  The
entire UNIX source file is included, without changes, into the RTEMS
source file.
