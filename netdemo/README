A simple application to test some of the RTEMS/FreeBSD networking code.

    **************************
    *          NOTES         *
    **************************

BE SURE TO LOCALIZE networkconfig.h.  FAILURE TO DO SO MAY PROVOKE YOUR
NETWORK ADMINISTRATOR TO THE POINT WHERE VICIOUS ATTACKS WILL BE MADE
UPON YOU.

Once this program is running on the target machine, you can test
the network code by:

 Typing commands at the target console:
    - show network statistics
    - transmit TCP packets
    - transmit UDP packets
    Run `telnet target_machine 24742' on another machines.
 Everything you type should be echoed back and noted on
 the target console.
 You can run more than one telnet session at once.
 You can use port number 24743 as well.
