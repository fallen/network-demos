INTRODUCTION
============
Example RPC server and client.

The test programs are symmetrical:
 - The client runs on the host machine or on the RTEMS target.
 - The server runs on the host machine or on the RTEMS target.


BUILDING
========
You must have rpcgen installed on your host machine.

You must build the host tools first:
	make -f Makefile.host

Then you can build the RTEMS version of the server
	make
or you can buile the RTEMS version of the client
	make SERVER=hostname
where hostname is the name of the machine running the RPC server.


RUNNING
=======
1) Server on RTEMS machine, client on host machine:
	Download and run the server code on the RTEMS machine
	Run the client on the host machine
		./rprintmsg rtems_hostname "Some message to print"

2) Server on host machine, client on RTEMS machine:
	Start server on host machine
		./server
	Download and run the client code on the RTEMS machine


CHANGING
========
If you want to try out more or different remote procedures:
	1) Make the changes to msg.x.
	2) Make the corresponding server changes to msg_proc.c.
	3) Make the corresponding client changes to rprintmsg.c.


FILES
=====
init.c      - RTEMS configuration/initial task.
msg.x       - Source file for rpcgen.
msg_main.c  - Server main routine -- RTEMS or host.
msg_proc.c  - Example implementation of RPC server-side routines.
rprintmsg.c - Client main routine -- RTEMS or host.


CLEANUP
=======
To clean up the results of the build process:
	make clean
	make -f Makefile.host clean
