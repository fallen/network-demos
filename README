CONFIGURATION NOTES

1. Make sure you change the definition of MY_ETHERNET_ADDRESS in 
   networkconfig.h before you try to use any of the network
   demonstration programs.

2. If you do not use BOOTP (i.e. the `#define USE_BOOTP 1' in init.c is
   removed), make sure you change the definition of MY_INTERNET_ADDRESS
   before you try to use the programs.

FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE ABOVE INSTRUCTIONS MAY PROVOKE YOUR NETWORK
